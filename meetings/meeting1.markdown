Met at the library, discussing use case diagram.

We will make the system specifically how it was asked in the specification and we have made a usecase diagram for that. We then need to create prototypes for each usecase and build up from there. The plan is to get everyone to do 1 use case. Each prototype will factor in user feedback.
