Met at the library, discussing use case diagram.

- We will make the system specifically how it was asked in the specification and we have made a usecase diagram for that. 
- We then need to create prototypes for each usecase and build up from there. 
- The plan is to get everyone to do 1 use case. Each prototype will factor in user feedback.
